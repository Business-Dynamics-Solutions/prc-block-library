# PRC Power Table Block
A fork of Aki Hamano's Flexible Table Block https://github.com/Aki-Hamano/flexible-table-block

## Things I've added
- A "go to column/row" modal
- A right click context menu on the cell with a slotfill so other devs can hook in and add menu items
- A csv import and export functionality and inspector panel as well as a dropzone for the block itself

## Things to add
- A table row settings to set a "row hover background color"
- Column sorting
- Responsive row collapsing
